# This creates an infrastructure for checks for JiTC*DE objects that works as follows:
# • Each check is registered as such by being decorated with `@checker`.
# • Each class that needs checks inherits from CheckEnvironment.
# • All checks are run with the method check.

		Performs a series of checks that may not be feasible at runtime (usually due to their length). Whenever you run into an error that you cannot make sense of, try running this. It checks for the following mistakes:
		
		* negative arguments of `y`
		* arguments of `y` that are higher than the system’s dimension `n`
		* unused variables
		
		Parameters
